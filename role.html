    <h1>Role of the Signal & Telecom Department</h1>

    <h2>Train Operations</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Signalling Systems for Safe and smooth train operations.</li>
        <li>Optimum utilization of line capacity.</li>
        <li>Train Warning and Protection systems.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Telecommunications</h2>
    <p>Providing telecommunication infrastructure for :</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Control Communication for Efficient operation of trains.</li>
        <li>Passenger Reservation System (PRS)</li>
        <li>Unreserved Ticketing System (UTS)</li>
        <li>Freight Operation Information System (FOIS)</li>
        <li>Crew Management System (CMS)</li>
        <li>Coaching Operating Information System (COIS)</li>

        <li>Management of Railways Information Network (RAILNET)</li>
        <li>Railways telephones, networked with all India Railway network.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Passenger Amenities</h2>
    <p>Signal & Telecom Department provides various passengers amenities for the benefit of travelling public:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Public Address System is provided at various stations to announce the arrival & departure of trains and other information required by traveling passengers.</li>
        <li>Train Arrival Departure Information is provided through Rail Sampark Centralized Service 139.</li>
        <li>Train Indication Boards are provided for indicating the train timing and platform numbers at important Railway stations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Elements of Safety in Train Operation</h2>

    <h3>Track Circuiting</h3>
    <p>Track circuiting is a basic safety device used in signalling systems. It monitors occupancy of a section of track and prevents clearance of signal in the event of the track section being occupied by another train. This is a fail-safe device, which in the condition of its failure prevents the signals to be cleared.</p>

    <h3>Axle Counters</h3>
    <p>It is another important safety device used for detecting presence of train in a track section. This device counts the number of train axles entering and exiting through a track section and controls the associated signal.</p>

    <h3>Block Working</h3>
    <p>It is an arrangement to control the entry and exit of train in a section called block section between any two adjacent stations. This maintains space interval between two following trains. It provides safety by preventing the second train to be sent into the section between the stations unless and until the previous train has cleared the section.</p>

    <h3>Driver to Guard communication</h3>
    <p>Driver to Guard communication has been provided for running trains using VHF walkie-talkie sets, for better co-ordination in controlling of the train.</p>

    <h3>Interlocking</h3>
    <p>Interlocking is a mechanism to check the route the train is going to traverse before clearing the signal and to prevent the clearing of signal when it is unsafe for the movement. It eliminates human error and ensures safety in train operations. Two types of interlocking arrangements are in vogue depending on the size of the station yard.</p>

    <h4>Panel Interlocking</h4>
    <p>Panel interlocking is provided for smaller yards. It is a signalling system, which assures the best standard of safety and eliminates the accidents arising out of human errors.</p>

    <h4>Route Relay Interlocking</h4>
    <p>Route Relay Interlocking is provided at major junctions and yards where large numbers of train movements are required.</p>

    <h3>Safety at Level Crossing Gates</h3>
    <p>All the level crossing gates in the station area and other important gates in the route are controlled by the signals. These gates are called interlocked gates and provide best safety for the road users. Provision of telephone communication at manned level crossing gates is a safety tool to ensure closure and opening of gates at appropriate time. On this railway all the manned level crossing gates have already been provided with telephone communication facility with the controlling stations.</p>
